## About Me

I am a PhD candidate and hold a Master’s degree in Political Science from the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), where I also completed my undergraduate studies in Social Sciences. I work in the areas of political behavior and political psychology, with a focus on experimental methods and quantitative analysis. Currently, my PhD research explores the relationship between religion and political behavior.
